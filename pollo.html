    <p>Wow! This is the recipe for <strong>Pollo a la parrilla!</strong>, the preferred poultry meat in <em>argentine asado.</em></p> 
    
    <p></p>If beef is your thing, then <a href="tira.html">Asado de tira</a> or <a href="vacio.html"> Vac√≠o a la parrilla</a> could be just the right thingy.</p>

    <p><strong>Pollo</strong> is the favorite poultry meat, unavoidable in argentine <em>asado.</em> Inexpensive and easy to cook, it pleases kids and people that does not eat red meat.</p>

    <p>Unlike beef, chicken must be thoroughly cooked before serving. To serve a bleeding chicken leg is worse than a capital sin.</p>
    
    <h3>What you will need:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>A whole chicken</li>
            <li>Butter, 50 g</li>
            <li>Mustard, 3 tsp</li>
            <li>Lemon juice, 50 cc</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Come on, let's burn the bastard!</h3>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Fire up the coal!</li>
            <li>While still burning with high flame, put the grill on top of the fire and let it heat.</li>
            <li>When hot, use crumpled old newspapers to clean the grill, removing all remains of past <em>asados.</em></li>
            <li>Wait for the coal to turn to white embers. That's the right time!</li>
            <li>Set the grill <em>beside</em> the embers. Use a shovel to put enough embers below the grill to make a thin layer.</li>
            <li>While the embers get to the right point, lay the chicken on a cutting board and cut the chest in half. </li>
            <li>Open the chicken, turn it over and press down with your hands to flatten it. The thing is <em>dead already,</em> show no mercy! Add salt for both sides.</li>
            <li>In a pot on the stove, mix the butter, mustard and lemon juice. Add salt and pepper as desired. Melt everything together and put aside.</li>
            <li>Place the chicken on the heated clean grill with the skin facing up.</li>
            <li>Use a brush to paint the chicken with the butter/mustard/lemon dressing. Repeat every 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Cook for about 30 minutes, then turn over. Brush with the dressing and cook for another 35 minutes.</li>
            <li>When the tendons of the legs break, the chicken is ready </li>
            <li><strong>Do not leave the pollo a la parrilla unattended!</strong> Do not go away, watch a movie or mow the lawn... Cooking pollo asado is a dire responsibility, you must make sure to keep the temperature right all the time, adding embers as required!</li>
            <li>Chop in as many pieces as suits your taste and serve immediately, before it gets cold.</li>
        </ol>
