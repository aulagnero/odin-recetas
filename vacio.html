    <h1>Vacío a la parrilla!</h1>
    <img src="./img/vacio-parrila.jpg" width="500" alt="beautiful photo of grilled cow thin flank">
    <p>Yipee! This is the recipe for <strong>Vacío a la parrilla!</strong>, one of the most important beef cuts in <em>argentine asado,</em> the other one being the <a href="tira.html">Asado de tira.</a></p>

    <p>If you prefer chicken, <a href="pollo.html">Pollo a la parrilla</a> could make your day.</p>

    <p>The <strong>Vacío</strong> is a boneless meat cut from the flank of the cow. Its shape resembles a triangle.</p>

    <p>It has a respectable amount of fat that greatly adds to its great taste, and also a layer of <em>cuerito</em>, a thin membrane that, if grilled right, gets all crispy and delicious.</p>
    
    <h3>What you will need:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>A whole piece of vacío</li>
            <li>Coarse Salt (fine salt is... acceptable)</li>
            <li>Chimichurri sauce (optional)</li>
            <li>Criolla sauce (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Hell yeah, let's grill it!</h3>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Fire up the coal!</li>
            <li>While still burning with high flame, put the grill on top of the fire and let it heat.</li>
            <li>When hot, use crumpled old newspapers to clean the grill, removing all remains of past <em>asados.</em></li>
            <li>Wait for the coal to turn to white embers. That's the right time!</li>
            <li>Set the grill <em>beside</em> the embers. Use a shovel to put enough embers below the grill to make a thin layer.</li>
            <li>While the embers get to the right point, lay the vacío flat on a cutting board and slice away the excess fat -you do not want to cut all the fat, just thin the thickest chunks. Also make sure to <em>not cut out the cuerito!</em></li>
            <li>Set the vacío on the grill with the <em>cuerito</em> facing down.</li>
            <li>Hold your hand over the meat and count 6-8 secs. Then, you should feel your hand starts to burn (take it away, now!) meaning the temperature is just right.</li>
            <li>Add as much coarse salt as you like, and let the meat cook for about 30-40 minutes.</li>
            <li>Turn over -using a clamp, do not puncture the meat because it would lose all its juices- and let cook for another 20/30 minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>Do not leave the asado unattended!</strong> Do not go away, jump in the pool or make a wedding proposal... Cooking asado is a heavy burden, you must make sure to keep the temperature right all the time, adding embers as required!</li>
            <li>Cut to 3 cm-wide loafs and serve swiftly, before it gets cold.</li>
        </ol>
