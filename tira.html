    <h1>Asado de Tira!</h1>
    <img src="./img/asado-de-tira-parrilla.png" width="500" alt="gorgeous photo of grilled cow ribs">
    <p>Yay! This is the recipe for <strong>Asado de Tira!</strong>, one of the most important beef cuts in <em>argentine asado,</em> the other one being the <a href="vacio.html">Vac√≠o a la parrila.</a></p>
        
    <p>If you prefer chicken, <a href="pollo.html">Pollo a la parrilla</a> could make your day.</p>

    <p>The <strong>Asado de Tira</strong> is the rib cage of the animal sawed to stripes across the bones, with the muscle on top.</p>

    <p>It has an, of course, unhealthy amount of fat that ensures that this meat is really tender and delicious, if not good for your blood vessels.</p>
    
    <h3>What you will need:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Asado de tira stripes, as many as required</li>
            <li>Coarse Salt (fine salt is... acceptable)</li>
            <li>Chimichurri sauce (optional)</li>
            <li>Criolla sauce (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Let's grill it, dammit!</h3>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Fire up the coal!</li>
            <li>While still burning with high flame, put the grill on top of the fire and let it heat.</li>
            <li>When hot, use crumpled old newspapers to clean the grill, removing all remains of past <em>asados.</em></li>
            <li>Wait for the coal to turn to white embers. That's the right time!</li>
            <li>Set the grill <em>beside</em> the embers. Use a shovel to put enough embers below the grill to make a thin layer.</li>
            <li>While the embers get to the right point, put coarse salt on that mofo stripes of asado!</li>
            <li>Set the stripes on the grill with the bones facing down.</li>
            <li>Hold your hand over the meat and count 6-8 secs. Then, you should feel your hand starts to burn (take it away, now!) meaning the temperature is just right.</li>
            <li>Let the meat cook this way for about 35 minutes.</li>
            <li>Turn over and let the boneless part cook for another 25 minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>Do not leave the asado unattended!</strong> Do not go away, drink beer and chat with the homies... Cooking asado is a priesthood, you must make sure to keep the temperature right all the time, adding embers as required!</li>
            <li>Serve swiftly, before it gets cold.</li>
